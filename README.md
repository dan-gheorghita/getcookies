# GetCookies.py

**Code Analysis**

The provided Python code is designed to read cookies from a file named `cookies.txt` and extract a specific list of cookies. Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

### Importing the `ast` Module

The code starts by importing the `ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees) module, which is used for parsing and evaluating Python expressions.

### Defining the `import_cookies` Function

The `import_cookies` function is defined to read the cookies from the `cookies.txt` file.

### Reading the Cookies File

 Inside the function, the code opens the `cookies.txt` file in read mode (`'r'`) and reads its contents into a string variable `text`.

### Parsing the Cookies Text

The code then uses a loop to parse the `text` string, searching for square brackets (`'['` and `']'`) to identify lists of cookies. The loop iterates through each character in the `text` string.
